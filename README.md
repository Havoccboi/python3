# How to predict which place will have a higher chance of pedestrian crash?

**Phase 1** :
 
> Using Clustering Algorithms to find the clusters:
> Algorithms Used:
>  1.K-means
>  2.DBSCAN
>>N.B: Optimal Number of cluster were found using Elbow's method and Agglomerative method. In our case optimal number of clusters
>> is 2.
